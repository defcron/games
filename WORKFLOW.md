# Development Workflow

This repository is built iteratively by multiple developers or agents.
Each development iteration should follow this workflow:

1. Implement or improve features for the game located in `webgl-game`.
2. After making code changes, update the documentation:
   - Summarize everything implemented so far.
   - Document changes made during the current iteration.
   - Describe remaining work and propose next steps for the following developer.
3. Commit code and documentation updates in a single pull request.

Agents or LLMs working on this project should read and adhere to this workflow to maintain continuity.
